I'm trying to bridge a channel in Slack with a channel in Discord (our team uses Discord to communicate, our client's team uses Slack). I want to be able to send messages in Discord, and they're received in the corresponding Slack channel. I also want to be able to send messages in Slack, and they're received in the corresponding Discord channel.

If possible, I'd like for these chat functionalities to work, too:

- Reactions (if someone "thumbs up"'s a message in Discord, it would "thumbs up" that same message in Slack

- Mentions (if someone types @USERNAME in Discord, it would "ping" USERNAME in Slack)

- Images + files (if I send an image to the channel in Discord, I'd like that same image to appear in Slack, and vice versa)
